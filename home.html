<h1>About Me!</h1>

<p>Hello, my name is Philippa, but my nickname is Flip. Im 18 years old and i've travelled from the cotswolds to go to DMU! At home I live with my older sister and my mum and dad, as well as my pets. I'm looking forward to eeing what city life has to bring compared to living in the countryside, I'm loving it so far! I love how everthing is on my doorstep and in walking distance! My interests include music, radio, concerts and festivals, basically <strong>all the FUN stuff!</strong> I can't wait to see where this new journey of university takes me! </p>
<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong>I've never done media production before! So this is taking me a little while to produce I just hope it works!I'm really enjoying the course so far and I hope i get better at it!</p>

<h2 style="color:red">What I'm enjoying about the course:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>It's really interesting! Considering I hadn't done media production before, I'm glad I'm enjoying the process of creating things</li>
  <li>I'm also loving the coding element (What i'm doing now!) It's a challenge, but, I'm enjoying looking at the outcome step-by-step</li>
  <li>I cant wait until I get the hang of it a bit more and process things a bit quicker, it'll be more fun once I can produce things more quickly and effectively!</li>
</ul>
