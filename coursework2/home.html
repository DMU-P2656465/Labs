<p class="p2"> This photo was sent in by Ian, aged 45 and really encapsulates the natural beauty of the Cotswolds. This was taken in a very beautiful town called Bibury, home to a trout farm and many beautiful walks open to the public. Feel free to upload your own photo on our Contact Us page. </p>
